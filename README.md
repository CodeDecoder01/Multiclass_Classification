# Multiclass_Classification
Comparison of various ML algorithms to perform multiclass classification

Algorithms utilized:

1. Decsion tree
2. Random Forest
3. Logistic Regression
4. Support Vector Machine
5. K-Nearest Neighbours

For the dataset used, Random Forest proves to be the best classifier.
The comparison is done based on the confusion matrix and accuracy scores.
The models are imported from scikit-learn module.
